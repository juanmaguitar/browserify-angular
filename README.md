# Browserify + Angular + Watch + ES2015

This repo contains a demo project that shows how to use ES2015 & CommonJS modules in an angular app and how to create a final `bundle.js` that can be used directly in the browser

This project also offers an ESLint configuration to encourage the use of some good practices in ES2015 & JS

_Note: It also shows the use of `controllerAs` syntax and (_non-angular-code_) classes as handlers of the controllers_

_Note: It also shows the load of styles (`scss`) from the JS using `require` (using `scssify` npm module)_

##Â Installation

```
npm install
```

## Watch (ES2015 & CommonJS) .js files and generate `bundle` 

```
npm run build:es2015:watch
```
